# Overview

**duo_web** - Duo two-factor authentication for web applications

Duo provides simple two-factor authentication as a service via:

1.  Phone callback
2.  SMS-delivered one-time passcodes
3.  Duo mobile app to generate one-time passcodes
4.  Duo mobile app for smartphone push authentication
5.  Duo hardware token to generate one-time passcodes

This package allows a web developer to quickly add Duo's interactive, self-service, two-factor authentication to any web login form â€” without setting up secondary user accounts, directory synchronization, servers, or hardware.

What's here:

* `js` - Duo Javascript library, to be hosted by your webserver.
* `csharp`, `java`, `php`, `python` - Duo web SDKs for ASP.NET, Java, PHP, and Python environments. See the README and examples contained within for details.
* `demos` -  Example integrations demonstrating how to use the duo_web SDK.

# Usage

How it works:

1. You add a secondary login page that contains Duo's Javascript snippet and IFRAME.
2. The user interacts with the Duo IFRAME for secondary login (or enrollment if it's their first time).
3. Duo's Javascript automatically posts a signed response from the IFRAME to a secondary login handler. This handler should use Duo's verify_response() to check that authentication succeeded.
